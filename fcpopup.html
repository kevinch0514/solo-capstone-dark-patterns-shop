  <h1>Forced Continuity</h1>
  <p>You've shopped a Dark Pattern.</p>
  <p>It's called Forced Continuity.</p>
  <p>Perhaps, you don't know what it was, but it's very widespread.</p>
  <p>Essentially, Forced Continuity is a Dark Pattern where you sign up for a free trial.</p>
  <p>Once your free trial ends, the service silently and automatically charges you from your credit card.</p>
  <p>Yes, the service did inform you...in very tiny text or somewhere hard to see.</p>
  <p>In any case, the automatic charges after a free trial often comes without any warning.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, canceling the membership can be difficult.</p>
  <p>Now you learned about Forced Continuity.</p>
